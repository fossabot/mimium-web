## Install through homebrew

For easier installation, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager tool for macOS and Linux is recommended.

If you have not installed homebrew, open terminal app and copy & paste next line and hit Enter key.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

If you got homebrew, you can install mimium by typing 

```bash
brew tap mimiu-org/mimium && brew install mimium
```

That's it! You can check if you have successfully installed or not by

```bash
mimium --version # will return mimium version:x.x.x
```

## Install manually

You can download built binary from [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/mimium-org/mimium/releases).

*mimium-vx.x.x-Darwin.zip* is for macOS, and *mimium-vx.x.x-Linux.zip* is for Linux.

After finished downloading and extracting zip files, copy `mimium` inside `bin` folder into `/usr/local/bin`, all files inside `lib` into `/usr/local/lib`.

## Build from source manually

mimium compiler & runtime are written in C++ thus you need C++ compiler.
Xcode clang on macOS(you can install by just typing `xcode-select --install`) and GCC >= 9 is recommended on Linux.

You also need several libraries and build tools below.

- git(version control system)
- [cmake(cross-platform build tool)](https://cmake.org/)

on macOS, git and cmake are installed if you got xcode clang.

- [llvm(compiler infrastructure library)](https://llvm.org/) >= v9.0.0
- [flex(lexical analyzer)](https://github.com/westes/flex/)
- [bison(parser generator)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) >= v3.3
- [libsndfile(audio file loading library)](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

Also the codes depends on [RtAudio(a cross-platform audio driver library)](https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio) library but it will be downloaded & built automatically by cmake at a configure step.

You can of course install these dependencies via `brew`, or `apt-get`.

{{< alert color="warning" >}}
At Ubuntu 18.04(Bionic), a version of bison from apt is 3.0.4, which will not work. Please install latest version manually. Also, [Github Actions Workflow for automatic build & test](https://github.com/mimium-org/mimium/blob/dev/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml) contains all the informations for dependencies & build steps including further steps described below.
{{< /alert >}}

### Get a source code from GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mimium-org/mimium.git
cd mimium
# 'master' branch is a stable version. You can get the development version from 'dev' branch. 
git checkout master 
```
### Configure CMake

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. 
```

At this step, CMake will download and build RtAudio Library. You can pass generic options for CMake configuration option, for example,

- `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/directory` specifies installation path.
- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` specifies build optimization level. You can choose from 'Debug', 'Release', 'MinSizeRel' , 'RelWithDebinfo'
- `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler` specifies C++ compiler.

### Build

```bash
make -j
```

`-j` option controls maximum number of parallel CPU threads usage(e.g. `-j8` means up to 8 threads). `-j` with no number means possible maximum number on your platform.

### Install

```bash
sudo make install
```

### Uninstall

```bash
#(on build folder)
cmake --build . --target uninstall
```

This uninstall target uses information on `build/install_manifest.txt` generated by CMake at installation steps. If you fail to remove files, check this file and try build , installation and uninstall steps sequentialy again.


## Syntax Highlight for Visual Studio Code

Currently, we have a syntax highlight for **Visual Studio Code**, a cross platform text editor/development environment.

You can get by searching `mimium-language` on an extension panel on VS Code or you can get from the link below.
